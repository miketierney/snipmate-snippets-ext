# Snipmate Snippets Extension

This repository is meant to be used in conjustion with [snipmate-snippets](https://github.com/honza/snipmate-snippets). I use it to maintain a separate directory of snippets that aren't included in the community maintained collection, but are still useful (at least to me).

## Usage

NOTE: This is **not** a Vim plugin. It perhaps should be, but it isn't. It relies on the presence of the snipmate-snippets plugin, which does all of the heavy lifting.

Somewhere useful for you, clone the repo:

For example, it can be stored in your `~/.vim` directory:

  $ cd ~/.vim
  $ git clone https://github.com/miketierney/snipmate-snippets-ext.git custom_snippets


## Contribution

I'll happily merge in pull requests, if I think the snippets are useful, but if you're trying to make a meaningful contribution to the overall snipmate-snippets-using community, I recommend sending a patch to that repository instead.
